                    Clean potatoes. Slice potatoes in half lengthwise. Lay the half potatoes on the flat side, then cut in half, lengthwise.
                    Turn over potatoes. Cut through the center to get wedges.

                <li>Place coated wedges onto the baking pan. Bake for around 30 minutes, flip them once halfway through.
